## Introduction

RISC-V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) designed to be simple, modular, and extensible. This project implements a basic RISC-V core with the ability to execute a subset of RISC-V instructions. The design is scalable and can be extended to support additional features like floating-point operations, caching, and advanced pipeline stages.

## Architecture

The core is based on the RISC-V 32-bit architecture (RV32I), which includes the following components:

- **Register File**: 32 general-purpose registers (32-bits each).
- **ALU**: Arithmetic and Logic Unit that supports integer operations.
- **Control Unit**: Decodes instructions and generates control signals.
- **Instruction Fetch Unit**: Fetches instructions from memory.
- **Instruction Decode Unit**: Decodes fetched instructions and identifies the operation.
- **Execution Unit**: Executes ALU operations and memory accesses.
- **Memory Unit**: Handles data access and storage.

## Features

- **RV32I Support**: Implements the base integer instruction set of RISC-V (RV32I).
- **5-Stage Pipeline**: The design follows a classic 5-stage pipeline: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback.
- **Branch Prediction**: Simple static branch prediction for faster instruction fetching.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Basic support for interrupt handling and exception management.
- **Configurable**: The design can be extended to support other RISC-V extensions like M (multiplication and division), A (atomic operations), F (floating-point), etc.

## Design Overview

The RISC-V core is designed using a modular approach, where each functional block (such as the ALU, control unit, and memory unit) is implemented separately. The design follows the principles of:

- **Simplicity**: The core is simple, making it easy to understand and extend.
- **Pipelining**: The 5-stage pipeline improves throughput by allowing multiple instructions to be processed in parallel.
- **Scalability**: The modular design makes it easy to add new features, such as support for more instruction sets or optimizations.

### Core Components:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**: The instruction fetch unit loads instructions from memory and forwards them to the decode stage.
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**: Decodes the instruction and issues control signals to the other stages.
3. **Execute (EX)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
4. **Memory (MEM)**: Handles memory read/write operations.
5. **Writeback (WB)**: Writes the results back to the register file.

## Getting Started

To get started with the RISC-V core design, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Verilog/VHDL Compiler**: The design is written in Verilog. Ensure you have a suitable simulator like ModelSim or XSIM.
- **Testbench**: The project includes testbenches to simulate the core's behavior.
- **Development Environment**: You can use any HDL development environment that supports Verilog.
